# Lab 3: Memory Engineering and Agent Memory

## Introduction

Agent Memory is the exocortex that augments an LLM—capturing, encoding, storing, linking, and retrieving information beyond the model’s parametric and contextual limits. It provides the persistence and structure required for long-horizon reasoning and reliable behaviour.

Memory Engineering is the scaffolding and control harness that we design to move information optimally and efficiently into, through, and across all components of an AI system(databases, LLMs, applications etc). It ensures that data is captured, transformed, organized, and retrieved in the right way at the right time—so agents can behave reliably, believably, and capabaly.

This is the core section of the notebook where we build a complete Memory Manager for AI agents.

Just like humans have different types of memory (short-term, long-term, procedural), AI agents benefit from specialized memory systems.
